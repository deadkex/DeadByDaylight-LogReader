# DeadByDaylight-LogReader (Outdated)
This was an old project to read the log of DeadByDaylight with the aim to finding the killer type while waiting in a lobby.
This project is for Educational Use only. I do not condone this software being used to gain an advantage against other people.

Basics used:
- Reading a file and extracting its content
- Creating Hotkeys for functions
- Usage of a config file to change Hotkeys/add Infos
