# DeadByDaylight-LogReader (Outdated)
This was an old project to read the log of DeadByDaylight with the aim to finding the killer type while waiting in a lobby.
It was made for self study purposes.

Basics used:
- Reading a file and extracting its content
- Creating Hotkeys for functions
- Usage of a config file to change Hotkeys/add Infos
